package.json and package-lock.json exist so ESLint can work when installed locally
Using ESLint is optional, but if you want to use it:
 - install Node.js and make sure you also get npm (it comes with Node by default)
 - while in the root folder for this project in the terminal, run "npm install"
 - install the ESLint VS Code extension
