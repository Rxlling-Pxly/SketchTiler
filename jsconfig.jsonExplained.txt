The "include" directive exists so typedefs.js found in the utility folder is always loaded by VS Code, even if the file isn't open
The directive is telling VS Code to load every js file that's in a subfolder of the root folder
The need for this directive caused the creation of jsconfig.json,
    and the creation broke multiple things about the project because it indicated that we no longer want things to be handled automatically for us;
    More on this later

"ESNext" exists so we can use Maps which normally comes with JS but we lost the ability to use them when we created jsconfig.json
"DOM" exists so we can use performance.now() which normally comes with JS but we lost the ability to use it when we created jsconfig.json
