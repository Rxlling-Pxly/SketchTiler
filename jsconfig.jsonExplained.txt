jsconfig.json exists so typedefs.js in the utility folder can work
The "include" directive makes this happen by ensuring the file is always loaded by VS Code, even if it isn't open
Actually, it's making sure *every* .js file is loaded by VS Code
I couldn't figure out how to make it only open typedefs.js

Creating jsconfig.json, however, broke multiple things around the project
Because its existence meant that we no longer wanted things to be handled automatically for us
"ESNext" and "DOM" fix what was broken
 - "ESNext" allows us to use Maps
 - "DOM" allows us to use performance.now()
