jsconfig.json exists so all files in the Types folder are always loaded into the project by VS Code
This allows us to use them without having to leave them opened in a tab
The files in the Types folder give us better typechecking and IntelliSense

jsconfig.json does this with the "include" directive
Technically, that directive is currently making it so *every* .js and .d.ts file is being loaded
I couldn't figure out how to make it only do the ones in the Types folder

Creating jsconfig.json broke multiple things around the project however
This is because its existence meant that we no longer wanted things to be handled automatically for us
The rest of the file exists to fix what was broken
 - "ESNext" allows us to use Maps
 - "DOM" allows us to use performance.now()
